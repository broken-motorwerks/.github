# Broken Motorwerks Telemetry

This project encompasses a real-time telemetry system for Broken MotorWerk's [LDRL](https://www.racelucky.com/) race car. It utilizes a Rust application running on an STM32 microcontroller to read CAN data from the vehicle and other sensors. This data is then broadcast over an XBEE RF link.
